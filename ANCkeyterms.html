                    <h2>Neurodiversity</h2> 
                    <p>The diversity of human minds and brains. Neurodiversity is a feature of groups of human beings, just as biodiversity is a feature of ecosystems.</p>

                    <h2>Autism</h2>
                    <p>A common, heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disability. There are debates about the proper way to refer to someone on the autism spectrum. Some people say “person with autism” (person-first language), but many of our members prefer to describe themselves as “autistic people” (identity-first language), because they see no reason why they should not be proud of their autism or why it should not be a positive part of their identities.</p>

                <div class="neurodiversity-movement">
                    <h2>Neurodiversity Movement</h2>
                    <p>A social and political movement that advocates for the inclusion and acceptance of neurodivergent people. In this respect, the neurodiversity movement opposes the application of the medical model to neurodivergent people (although neurodiversity advocates still endorse use of medical approaches to cure medical conditions that co-occur with neurocognitive disabilities). Our Autism & Neurodiversity Community embraces the neurodiversity approach and rejects the medical model.</p>

                        <h2>Disability</h2>
                        <p>A disability is something that causes a person to encounter barriers in their daily life, restricting their capacity to accomplish tasks and participate in society. Under the traditional medical model, disabilities were blamed on impairments within people, and interventions aimed to “cure” people of their disabilities by eliminating these impairments. More progressive models of disability like the social model and interactionist models direct attention towards the manner in which society and social organization can contribute towards the exclusion of disabled people. The social and interactionist models thus emphasize the necessity of reforming society to be more inclusive of disabled people.</p>

                    <div class="neurotypical">
                        <h2>Neurotypical</h2>
                        <p>A person whose mind and brain are not disabled, meaning that the person is able to accomplish cognitive and mental tasks necessarily for daily life and social participation without encountering barriers. Neurotypical people’s minds and brains generally function in an approximately species-typical manner.</p>

                        <p>A person whose mind or brain is disabled, meaning that the person encounters barriers when trying to accomplish cognitive and mental tasks necessarily for daily life and social participation. Autistic people are neurodivergent people, along with ADHD people, people with learning disabilities, and a number of other neurodivergent “cousins” of autistic people.</p>
