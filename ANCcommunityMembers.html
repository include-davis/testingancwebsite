    <div class="text_box">
      <p>
        First of all, autistic and neurodivergent faculty and staff are certainly welcome to join our peer-support
        community.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Moreover, whether you are neurodivergent or neurotypical, if you are interested in learning more
        about the experiences of autistic and neurodivergent students and hearing our recommendations about how you can
        better teach and support neurodivergent students, we are happy to discuss conducting a training session for your
        department/center.

    <!-- Why neurodiversity -->
    <h1 class="header">Why Neurodiversity?</h1>
    <div class="text_box">
      <p>
        Neurodiversity may be the next great frontier of human diversity.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        We believe that support for the
        neurodiversity movement follows naturally from the UC Davis Principles of Community, UC Davis’ goal of rejecting
        discrimination, and UC Davis’ commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.
      </p>

      <br>
      <p>
        Neurodivergent students are an
        increasingly important part of the modern postsecondary campus community. For example, 0.7-1.9% of students are
        autistic (White et al., 2011) and ~7.5% are on the ADHD spectrum (McKee, 2008).
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, neurodivergent
        students graduate at much lower rates than the general population. In the United States, less than 39% of
        autistic students complete their programs, compared to over 52% of neurotypical students. Moreover, these are
        data aggregated across all types of programs: gaps in retention between disabled and non-disabled students are
        much larger for 4-year institutions like UC Davis (Newman et al., 2011).
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Many of the barriers are non-academic:
        autistic college students experience higher rates of depression, anxiety, social isolation, and bullying (McLeod
        et al., 2019), and sexual assault (Brown et al., 2017), than neurotypical students. Moreover, neurodivergent
        students often have intersectional identities as LGBTQIA+ or racialized people.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Other barriers are more
        explicitly academic. Neurotypical students effectively receive accommodations by default, because colleges and
        universities are naturally geared towards the needs and learning styles of the majority. Neurodivergent students
        have different needs, but accommodating and including neurodivergent students can benefit neurotypical students
        as well. Applying principles of Universal Design in this way does not coddle students or require lowering of
        academic expectations – on the contrary, making it easier for all students to learn should allow us to expect
        greater excellence.

    <!-- Training Objectives -->
    <h1 class="header">Training Objectives</h1>
    <div class="text_box">
      <p>Our standard training objectives are:</p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 0; padding-left: 40px;">
        <li>To foster an appreciation of the importance of neurodiversity and inclusion</li>
        <li>To expose faculty/staff to neurodivergent students' first-person perspectives</li>
        <li>
          To provide specific recommendations regarding ways in which staff/faculty in specific parts of the
          university can better support autistic and disabled students.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <div class="text_box" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
      <p>
        In general, we conduct two types of trainings: focused presentations and panel discussions.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Focused presentations are delivered by an autistic/neurodivergent member of the Autism & Neurodiversity
        Community. They incorporate lecture content, along with opportunities for interactive discussion and viewing of
        recorded videos presenting first-person experiences of other neurodivergent students from our community.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Panel discussions are delivered by a panel of autistic/neurodivergent members of the Autism & Neurodiversity
        Community. After introducing themselves and presenting messages they feel are important for staff/faculty to
        know, panelists will take audience questions. Note that, because of the larger number of students needed for
        panel discussions, it can be more difficult to schedule these.

        Note that the Autism & Neurodiversity Community at UC Davis is a group run by and for neurodivergent students. 
        We are not part of the UC Davis administration. As such, the views expressed on this website should not be taken
        to reflect the positions of UC Davis.
